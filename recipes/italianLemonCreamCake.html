            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>⅔ cup confectioners' sugar, divided, plus more for dusting</li>

            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>       
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with cooking 
            spray.</li>
            <li>Measure 1 cup cake mix; set aside for crumb topping. Place the remaining cake mix in a large bowl; 
            add 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk, eggs, and oil. Beat cake mix mixture using an electric mixer until 
            batter is thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Mix melted butter and vanilla extract together in a bowl; stir in reserved 1 cup cake mix until mixture 
            is crumbly. Sprinkle crumbs over top of cake batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 
            to 35 minutes. Cool cake to room temperature in the pan.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl until 
            smooth and creamy. Beat cream and remaining 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold cream cheese mixture into whipped cream.</li>  
            <li>Remove cake from springform pan. Cut cake horizontally into 2 layers using a serrated knife; remove top 
            layer. Spread filling onto the bottom cake layer; place top cake over filling. Refrigerate cake for at 
            least 4 hours. Dust cake with more confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>   
        </ol>
