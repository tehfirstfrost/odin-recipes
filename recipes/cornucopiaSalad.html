        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>The name of this salad says it all. This salad is a meal in its self when served with fresh hot bread. </p>

        <p>It pairs really well with pretty much everything. It's nice to have something that's so simple to 
        throw together. yet always seems to be a favorite among all of your guests. I've even prepared it for the 
        days after Thanksgiving and thrown leftover turkey into it.</p>
